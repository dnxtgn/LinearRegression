# LinearRegression

This repo contains a basic code written in Python to use linear regression technique to calculate the number of candidate who were admitted or not in GMAT exam. 

In this code I was able to get an accuracy of 0.8 i.e 80%. 

This LR Model was able to predict 8 times correctly out of 10..
